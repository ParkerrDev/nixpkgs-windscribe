nixpkg for https://github.com/Windscribe/Desktop-App

In response to: https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/zpsk1h/i_try_to_package_windscribe_the_vpn_client/

and: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/158368


### The Nix Module

This project has two parts, a Nix module, and a windscribe executable / service.

To test the module, cd into the windscribe folder and run:

`nix-build -E 'with import <nixpkgs> { }; callPackage ./default.nix { }'`

`./result/bin/windscribe-cli --version`

If you get a version back then it is working!

Since everyones config is structured a little differently, you will have to figure out how and where to incorporate the 'windscribe' folder module in your Nix flake and configuration.

In my configuration.nix I have:

```nix
services.windscribe = {
enable = true;
autoStart = true;  # Optional: set to false if you don't want it to start automatically
};
```

You must put the windscribe folder into your NixOS configuration as a module. The windscribe folder contains default.nix and package.nix files. The Wiregaurd protocol will not work without this step, and the VPN will not connect. 'windscribe' must be declared as a module in your Nix flake.


### Running The Executable(s)

there's no service related stuff set up for this yet, so you'll need to manually start the helper:
```bash
# (in another shell/run it in the background/etc)
sudo nix run .#windscribe_helper
```

then actually run the main windscribe executable:
```bash
nix run .#
```
